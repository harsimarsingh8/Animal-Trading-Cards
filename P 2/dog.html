			<p>The St. Bernard didn't actually ever have a small barrel of brandy about its <br>neck. They should be known as the "dog rescuer," instead. Gaining their name from the dangerous St. Bernard pass in the Alps between Italy and Switzerland, the breed was famous for rescuing people lost in the snow and in avalanches.</p>
